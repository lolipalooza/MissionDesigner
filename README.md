This is barely on an early developement stage and has no functionalities yet.

## Requirements

- CLEO 4: https://cleo.li/
- Modloader: https://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=25377

## Description

The aim of _Mission Designer_ is to explote the 100% of the GTA SA SCM coding possibilities, and offer this through the most user-friendly menu as possible, but at the same time, be an useful tool for coders too, offering some kind of source SCM code exportable as plain text.

Mission Designer will also include an extra tool to let users to design a GUI (graphical user interface) with a cursor, to be usable ingame as the user needs. And even a _Director Mode_, that will let users to create easily cutscenes with all kind of camera options and animations, not only to be used in the created missions, but with options to export the SCM source code as plain text!
